# Intro_to_R
A quick introduction to working in R and RStudio presented at the LJI Bioinformatics meeting.

## Intended Use
This should serve as a quick walk-through of some of the basic principles of working in R. If you have coding experience, much of this may feel like review, but there are some tricks to R that I will explain that may benefit you!

The markdown file will go over some simple operations in R, reading in a file, and doing rudimentary data processing and analysis.
